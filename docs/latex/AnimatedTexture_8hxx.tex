\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the declaration of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classAnimatedTexture}{Animated\+Texture}} class. 

This file defines the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classAnimatedTexture}{Animated\+Texture}}} class, which is used to manage and control an animation made up of multiple textures (frames). The class provides functionality for loading a sequence of frames, playing, pausing, stopping, and updating the animation based on time. Additionally, it allows drawing the animated texture on screen with specified transformations.

The animation system is controlled through several public methods, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Play()}, {\ttfamily Pause()}, {\ttfamily Stop()}, {\ttfamily Resume()} to control the animation playback.
\item {\ttfamily Update()} to progress the animation based on elapsed time.
\item {\ttfamily Draw()} to render the current frame of the animation to the screen.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Key features include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Frame-\/based animation with adjustable frame rate.
\item Support for looping and pausing the animation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This class relies on a naming convention for texture files (e.\+g., \char`\"{}texture\+\_\+name\+\_\+0.\+png\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}texture\+\_\+name\+\_\+1.\+png\char`\"{}, etc.) to load the sequence of frames. 
\end{DoxyNote}
